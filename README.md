# LaTeXPackages
This repository contains pdf manuals of latex packages. LaTex requires lots of coding and hard to remember them all the times. While most, if not all, packages are available openly in the cran network, it takes time to search, locate, and relocate them again and again. This is inefficient and formatting takes more time than anything else. So, I am compiling manuals that are frequently use as a one-stop repository to access all important latex packages. I will try to keep this directory updated with the most recent version of each packages. However, I may not be able to catch up with all the development. So, please feel free to send pull request to make changes. Files are arranged in alphabetical order using name of the package making it easier to search. In long run, I plan to upload LaTeX templates that I developed so you don't have to built again. I must say, overleaf templates are not enought to meet my needs and preferences. I don't own any copyright for these files and these files are openly available. I am just compiling them for ease access. Please let me know if you want me to remove any of these files from the repository.
